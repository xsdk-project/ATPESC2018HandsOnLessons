Instructions here are divided into _required_ and _optional_ steps.
We expect everyone to, minimally, completed all _required_ steps here.
The _optional_ steps are likely to improve your experience by simplifying
or improving performance of certain operations.

## Required Steps

Please complete the followig _required_ steps prior to the beginning of the session
on Monday, August 6th.

1. Log Into Cooley
  * Use secure shell with compression, and trusted X forwarding enabled
```
ssh -l <username> -C -Y cooley.alcf.anl.gov
```
1. Copy Installed Software
* Once you are logged into Cooley, please execute the following instruction
to create a local, editable copy of numerical package software.
```
cd ~
rsync -a {{site.handson_install_root}}/{{site.handson_root}} .
```
  * **Note 1:** do not include a trailing slash, `/` in the path argument.
  * **Note 2:** You may be asked periodically throughout the day to re-execute
this command to update your local copy if we discover changes are necessary.
1. Confirm you can compile and run an example
  * As a test case, use an example from hypre to confirm you can compile
    and run an example
```
qsub -I -n 1 -t 5 -A ATPESC2018
cd HandsOnLessons/hypre
touch ij.c
make ij
mpiexec -n 4 ./ij
echo $?
exit
``` 
  * The `qsub` command reserves a cooley node for interactive work for 5 minutes.
    You may have to wait a moment for the interactive prompt on the reserved node to return.
  * The above commands should produce makefile and execution output. In particular
    the last `echo` command should produce a `0` response.
1. As soon after 9am, Monday, August 6th as possible, allocate an interactive node on
   cooley. The following command allocates a single Cooley node (`-n 1`) for 480 minutes
   (`-t 480`) using the ATPESC2018 allocation (`-A ATPESC2018`) and the training reservation (`-q training`):
```
qsub -I -n 1 -t 480 -A ATPESC2018 -q training
```
The command blocks until the node is ready.  Until the allocation expires (480mins in this example), all commands executed in the returned session will run on the allocated compute node; `mpiexec` can be used directly instead of going through `qsub`.
  * **Note 1:** The special `-q training` will not be functional until 9am, August 6th and will go away 9pm that same day.
  * **Note 2:** All the software here can also run on the login nodes of Cooley. However, we ask that you please
    **DO NOT** run jobs on the login nodes and instead run them on a reserved allocation.
  * **Note 3:** Be aware, however, that starting new jobs on the reserved node too close to the allocation's expiration
    may result in the allocation going away before your job completes.

### About your Day

#### Hands On Exercises
Lectures and brief hands-on exercises will be interleaved throughout the day.
Deeper dive hands-on lessons will be in the evening.

Day-time hands-on will be brief runs of examples and exposure to key concepts
following fairly structured lesson plans. 

Evening hands-on will permit deeper dive into hands-on exercises of your choosing
and with less structured lessons.

#### Points and Prizes!
We have some fun prizes at the end of the evening! We will be keeping track of
hands-on exercise progress and points totals. At the end of the evening session,
the highest point getters will be rewarded with some cool gifts.

#### Q&As and Show-Your-Works
We have tried to design most of the hands-on lessons (day-time or evening) with
questions for which you will submit Google Forms for your answers.

During day-time hands-on exercises, the expandable question-and-answer boxes
inline with the lesson (which ordinarily show the correct answers) will be disabled
but will provide a link to an associated Google From for you to submit your answers.

During most of the evening hands-on exercises, you will submit a _Show-Your-Work_
Google form by going to the main menu (upper left of the site)
Intro->Submit A Show Your Work.

#### For Evening Hands-On, Work in Teams (2-4)
For the evening hands-on exercises, we encourage participants to work in teams of 2-4.
First, this helps us to cut down the number of IT issues that may arise during hands-on
exercises.  Moreover, [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)
(the practice of having two people work together
on one machine, each taking turns between typing and commenting) results in real-time
code review, which [research has shown](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584909000123)
results in higher productivity. Finally, if you are not using an OSX or Linux laptop, it would
be best to try to pair with someone who is.

#### Subject Matter Expert One-on-Ones
We are providing a [sign-up form](https://goo.gl/forms/KGzU8lr9WqvEBoL92)
to arrange brief (10-15 min) one-on-one discussions with numerical software experts in the
evening which you can also find under the Intro menu. If you are interested,
please sign up by 4 pm CT (end of the afternoon break). After dinner, we will provide a
schedule for evening one-on-ones.  This is a great opportunity to discuss detailed issues
with experts in the field. You will, of course, have to decide how best to balance any
one-on-one discussions with your evening hands-on exercise activities as these activities
will both occurr concurrently.

#### Red Post-Its
For day-time hands-on exercises, you will be given a red sticky note to use if you encounter
issues running hands on lessons. Instead of raising hands and interrupting the a day-time lesson,
we ask that you please place a red sticky note on the edge of your laptop display. Members
of the numerical software team will be watching and roaming the room looking for anyone that
has such notes _flying_ and will provide assistance. We ask that you please wait for a member
of the numerical software team to see it and come to help. If you correct the problem yourself
before you have been helped, remove the red note and set it aside until you need it again.
This protocol is necessary only during the day-time hands-on.

If you are running a Windows laptop or Chromebook, please be prepared to pair
with someone on OSX or Linux sitting near you or just follow the pre-tested lesson content.

#### Tech Support
You may also send email to
[Mark Miller, miller86@llnl.gov, Satish Balay,balay@mcs.anl.gov and Cameron Smith, smithc11@rpi.edu](mailto:balay@mcs.anl.gov,smithc11@rpi.edu,miller86@llnl.gov?subject=ATPESC2018%20Tech%20Support)

#### Chat Option
* We plan to provide a chat option, which you can also find under the Intro menu. We ask
that you please exercise discretion and use this chat only for interactions as they pertain
to todayâ€™s material and exercises.


## Visualization Tools

There are three options



**Note**: Client-Server is Best Option

#### Installing and Setting up VisIt for Client-Server to Cooley

#### Installing and Setting up ParaView for Client-Server to Cooley

**Can Cameron write this section?**


### Running Remotely via X-Windows

**Note**: Requires X-Server with indirect GLX enabled.

### VisIt

#### Client-Server vs. All Local

**Note**: add `@visit` to `~/.soft.cooley` and run `resoft` on Cooley login node

### ParaView

### GlVis

## Transferring Data

### Secure Shell Control Master

### Secure File Transfer Protocol (sftp)




currently, just notes to self

* confirm cooley login
* confirm display via x back to laptop
* confirm editor(s) available (vi, nano, ...)
* confirm run apps in /projects/ATPESC2018
* confirm run VisIt
  * install instructs for local VisIt
* confirm run ParaView
  * install instructs for local ParaView (don't know this)
* confirm run glvis
* confirm run gnuplot
* windows, osx and linux specific setup
* vnc setup and/or script?
* run a script (we still need to write) to set paths, etc.
* instructions on reserving a node (w/ Cobalt) If request interactive, get it immediately

* As a back up, confirm all above on NERSC/Cori
  * perhaps this is too much to ask?
